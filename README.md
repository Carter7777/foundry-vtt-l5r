Legend of the Five Rings (5E)
-------------------

This game system for [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/) provides a character sheet and basic systems to play [Fantasy Flight Game's](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/index/) Legend of the Five Rings 5th edition.

You'll still need to [buy the books from FFG](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/legend-of-the-five-rings-roleplaying-game/) to have access to the game rules and content.
